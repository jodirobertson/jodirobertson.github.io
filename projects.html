            <h2>A Bookworm's Life</h2>
            <p>After taking a Database Design class during my study abroad in New Zealand, I created a PostgreSQL database of all the books I've read since high school.</p>
            <p>Here's a word cloud of the keywords I used to describe the books:</p>

            <img src="images/wordcloud.png" alt="Some of the most common words are family, love, black, medicine, healthcare, friendship, memoir, school, parenting, and running."/>

            <p id="footnote">Created using <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com/"><em>https://www.wordclouds.com/</em></a>.</p>
            
            <p>Then, I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to connect to PostgreSQL.</p>
            
            <img src="images/api.png" alt="I used Postman to test it."/>
            
            <p id="footnote">Here's the <a href="https://github.com/jodirobertson/books-api"><em>repo</em></a> in Github.</p>

            <h2>Urban Beekeeping in Boston</h2>

            <p>Honey bees are on the decline worldwide, posing a threat to our ecosystems and global food supply. This map explores the potential for urban beekeeping in Boston.</p>
            <img src="images/beekeep.jpg" alt="There are relatively few areas suitable to beekeeping in the Boston city lines.">

            <p id="footnote">Suitability was calculated using a Weighted Sum of variables including proximity to water, temperature, elevation, and potential for pollinators within the Boston city limits. The methodology was based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X17300694"><em>this study</em></a> conducted in Italy.</p>

            <h2>Animation Creator</h2>
            <p>I used a Model-View-Controller & Decorator pattern to animate shapes using SVG in Java. This was my first Object-Oriented Design project, and I had a lot of fun building it!</p>
            <img src="images/shapesAnimator.jpg" alt="The shapes are 2D objects, and the animation allows for scrubbing, changing the speed, looping, and printing out as an SVG file.">
            <p id="footnote">Here's the <a href="https://github.com/jodirobertson/shapesAnimations"><em>repo</em></a> in Github.</p>

            <h2>Imposter</h2>
            <p>I wrote and designed this website using HTML and CSS as part of my first hackathon at SheHacks Boston. Its aim was to be a more transparent, wage-gap-focused version of Glassdoor.</p>
            <img src="images/imposter1.jpg" alt="The home page has a search bar for company names.">
            <img src="images/imposter2.jpg" alt="The top ten best companies are listed, along with average intern and full-time salaries. Male intern salaries are about $16,000 more than female salaries. The average full-time salary of a male is about $13,000 more than that of a female.">
            <p id="footnote">Data was gathered and anonymized from surveys taken during the hackathon.</p>
