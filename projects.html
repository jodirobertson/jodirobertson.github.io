            <h2>A Bookworm's Life</h2>
            <p>Currently, I'm working on building a data visualization of all the books I've read since graduating high school, based on a PostgreSQL database I created.</p> 
            <p>Meanwhile, here's a word cloud of the keywords I used to describe the books:</p>

            <h2>Urban Beekeeping in Boston</h2>

            <p>Honey bees are on the decline worldwide, posing a threat to our ecosystems and global food supply. This map explores the potential for urban beekeeping in Boston.</p>

            <p id="footnote">Suitability was calculated using a Weighted Sum of variables including proximity to water, temperature, elevation, and potential for pollinators within the Boston city limits. The methodology was based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X17300694"><em>this study</em></a> conducted in Italy.</p>

            <h2>Animation Creator</h2>
            <p>I used a Model-View-Controller & Decorator pattern to animate shapes using SVG in Java. This was my first Object-Oriented Design project, and I had a lot of fun building it!</p>

            <h2>Imposter</h2>
            <p>I wrote and designed this website using HTML and CSS as part of my first hackathon at SheHacks Boston. Its aim was to be a more transparent, wage-gap-focused version of Glassdoor.</p>
